# Simple CRUD App (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This is a **basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application** built with **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**.  
I tested all routes using **Postman**.  
The project demonstrates how to structure a backend with routes, controllers, and models in a clean, modular way.
